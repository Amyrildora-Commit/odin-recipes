        <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>
                Wines of Zamorak cannot be consumed, but are used as a secondary ingredient in creating ranging and bastion potions. The bloody grimoire states that the wine is incredibly unholy but has a sweet taste that makes it easily addictive. It is possible that the wine is used in the making of bloody bracers, as they have a similar side effect upon drinking.
